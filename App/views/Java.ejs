        General Info
        <p class="content">
          The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the
          early 1990s. Java has been one of the most widespread and most
          efficient programming languages out there, for a very long time. The
          reason being that it has many benefits and perks that help programmers
          solve complex real-world problems at an ease.
        </p>

        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <ul class="content">
          <li>
            Object oriented programming language- One of the main advantages of
            Java is it is object-oriented language. We all know that procedural
            languages are very complicated and hard to implement but this
            concept helps Java solve real world problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secure language- Java uses concepts like encapsulation, abstraction,
            inheritance, which increases security and prevents unauthorized
            access to users
          </li>
          <li>
            Cheap and economical to maintain- Due to its simple build, java is
            cheap and easy to develop and maintain. Java can run on any machine
            regardless of the hardware of the system, this reduces cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            Platform independent- The java programs written in a system can be
            run on any other system that has java in it, this makes it super
            flexible
          </li>
          <li>
            Supports Multithreading- To gain maximum CPU utilization,
            multithreading is a key component. Java is a programming language
            that supports multithreading
          </li>
          <li>
            Distributed language- Java has the mechanism for sharing data and
            programs among multiple computers, so it is a distributed
            programming language
          </li>
        </ul>
      </main>
      <section class="box">
        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <ul class="content">
          <li>
            Slower and poor performance- Java is slower compared to C and C++
            this is due to the additional work of the interpreter to convert the
            code into machine language.
          </li>
          <li>
            Poor GUI- Java is considerably backwards when it comes to GUI. The
            GUI builder in java is poor and is unable to build complex UI.
          </li>
          <li>
            No backup facility- Java has absolutely zero features to back up the
            data of users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paid commercial license- Oracle announced in January 2019 that they
            will charge a fee for the commercial license of Java 11 and above.
            FEE MUST BE PAID.
          </li>
