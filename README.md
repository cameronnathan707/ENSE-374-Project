# Project Idea
Create a coding language ranking system where users will rank different coding languages and submit that to a community ranking where you can see the average ranking of languages, and some basic info on the language and its popularity on a time line   

# Project background/Business Opportunity
The Rankings would allow programmers to rank and view the average rankings of popular languages. This would be beneficial for new programmers as they can learn new languages based on popularity and use, and allow businesses a way to see what is popular at the time for keeping their code base up to date. Having some basic information on the language lets the programmers and companies see which languages can fit their use case or what they can be helpful for. This creates an easy way to get to know the languages that are favored by seasoned developers.
